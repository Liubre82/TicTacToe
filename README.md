# Tic Tac Toe Game
The Tic Tac Toe game is played through the terminal.
The game allows 2 users to play or you can play with the computer.

The purpose of the project was to practice java, writing some logic
and better understanding of the fundamentals of Java like 
Object Oriented Programming and design patterns like the
Factory Design Pattern I used for the Player abstract class.

To run the program, just run it through the LaunchGame.java file
inside the launchgame package.
